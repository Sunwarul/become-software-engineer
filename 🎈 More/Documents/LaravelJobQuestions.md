# Laravel developer job questions

**Question: ** What is REST API ? Write some most used REST API authentication methods.

**Answer:**  REST stands for "Representational State Transfer". It is a set of rules that developer follow when they create their API. One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (called resource) when you link to a specific URL.

A request consists of four parts

1. Endpoint (Path, Query params[cURL] ? & = ,  )
2. Method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETEs)
3. Headers
4. Data(body)

and optional query parameters.
